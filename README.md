<h2>Description</h2>
This program can generate, time, record, and analyze solves for 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 and 6x6 puzzles. 
For each solve, a WCA verified shuffle will be generated and aof5 and aof12 will be recorded. 
Users have the option to delete solves (modifying the averages in doing so), access history and access statistics for each puzzle.
